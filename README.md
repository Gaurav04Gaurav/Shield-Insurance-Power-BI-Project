# Shield-Insurance-Power-BI-Project

🛡️ About the Project:

I created a Power BI dashboard for Shield Insurance to track important business numbers like Total Revenue and Customer Count.
 The dashboard has interactive charts and filters that help understand performance by Sales Method and Age Group.
It also includes trends, filters, and visuals to support smart, data-based business decisions.

🧑‍💻 What I Learned and Used:

• Connecting and relating different tables
 • Writing DAX formulas, including Month-over-Month (MoM) comparison
 • Using colors and arrows to highlight changes
 • Designing interactive visuals (Cards, Slicers, Buttons)
 • Tracking KPIs and analyzing age group performance
 • Cleaning and shaping data in Power Query

📊 Tools Used:

 Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Data Cleaning | Dashboard Design
